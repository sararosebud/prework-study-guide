            <li>When a developer wants to style an element directly in the HTML file, they use inline CSS.</li>
            <li>The most common way to style a webpage is by using an external CSS style sheet.</li>

  <li>it's important to frequently sync the local version of your code with the remote version in GitHub. This matters, especially when working on a team, so that a functional, updated version of the project can be shared and accessed by all team members. Working on an outdated or stale version can lead to big sync problems. That's why it is best practice to resolve and iterate on smaller changes, rather than wait for an accumulation of many small and large changes, which could complicate conflict resolution and debugging.</li>
  <li>We use the add -A command to commit all files in the working branch.</li>  
<li>We use the -m flag to associate a message with our commit. Commit messages should be short descriptive messages of the changes implemented. Once completed, our Git repository is now up to date with our working directory!</li>
<li> git pull origin main makes sure the current branch is up to date before opening a pull request.</li>

          <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        
          <ul>
               <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
              <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
              <li>JavaScript (JS) is a high-level dynamic programming language that allows users to interact with websites.
              </li>
              <li>Using JavaScript, you can power your websites with effects, interactivity, data communication, and much more</li>
              <li>In web development, JavaScript is the tool that takes a static HTML/CSS webpage and makes it interactive.
              </li>
              <li>Every time you do something with a webpage, such as click a button, retrieve data, or fill out a form, JavaScript is at work!
              </li>
              <li>Wwith more experience, you'll be able to create games, animated 2D and 3D graphics, comprehensive database-driven apps, and much more!</li>
              <li>In JavaScript, to declare a variable, we use the var keyword.
              </li>
              <li>After the var keyword, we give the variable a name</li>
              <li>This name must be unique because it is how we will reference the information stored in the variable in our code.</li>
              <li>Finally, we use an assignment operator = to assign the specific data that we want stored in our variable.
                All strings are surrounded by quotation marks. Note that each line of JavaScript code ends with a semicolon
               </li>
               <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
               <li>In JavaScript, code runs from the first statement at the top of the page, down to the last statement at the bottom of the page</li>
               <li>JavaScript is read from top to bottom, and order counts. This means that we must be intentional about how we set up code in a JS file</li>
               <li>Control flow can be interrupted, however. We can use conditional statements and loops to control the order in which code is executed, or if it is even executed at all</li>
               <li>An if statement is a way of introducing decision-making into our code. 
                Code will only execute if the statement meets a condition, or is true.</li>
                <li>When the computer encounters an if statement in a JavaScript file, it will check to see if the condition that we provide is truthy.
                  If it is, then it will do whatever action we ask it to do in between the curly brackets. 
                  </li>
               <li>If the condition isn’t true or has a value that isn’t truthy, then the computer will ignore whatever is in between the curly brackets and move on.
              </li>
              <li>Sometimes we want to provide more conditions than just if. 
                In JavaScript, we can have more than one condition by using else if,
                </li>
              <li>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data. Arrays are typically used to hold data that is related in some way.
                To create an array, we declare a variable in the same way that we declared a variable with only one data item.
