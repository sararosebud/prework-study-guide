            <li>When a developer wants to style an element directly in the HTML file, they use inline CSS.</li>
            <li>The most common way to style a webpage is by using an external CSS style sheet.</li>
            <li> allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier.</li>

  <li>it's important to frequently sync the local version of your code with the remote version in GitHub. This matters, especially when working on a team, so that a functional, updated version of the project can be shared and accessed by all team members. Working on an outdated or stale version can lead to big sync problems. That's why it is best practice to resolve and iterate on smaller changes, rather than wait for an accumulation of many small and large changes, which could complicate conflict resolution and debugging.</li>
  <li>We use the add -A command to commit all files in the working branch.</li>  
<li>We use the -m flag to associate a message with our commit. Commit messages should be short descriptive messages of the changes implemented. Once completed, our Git repository is now up to date with our working directory!</li>
<li> git pull origin main makes sure the current branch is up to date before opening a pull request.</li>
