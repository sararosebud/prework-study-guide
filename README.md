This Prework Study Guide was created as a webpage to store prework notes for bootcamp. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, git, and JavaScript. 
As a Bootcamp Student, I wanted a place to store my notes. 
Creates an organized place to store notes for Bootcamp, and helps to actively learn code while taking notes. 
I learned about HTML, CSS, git, and JavaScript and how they apply to coding while getting hands on and real time experience.
